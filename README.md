#### Abstract
> While the field of microbial biogeography has largely focused on the contributions of abiotic factors to community patterns, the potential influence of biotic interactions, such as those mediated by the production of specialized metabolites, in structuring microbial communities remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between microbial community structure and specialized metabolism at local spatial scales in marine sediment samples collected from the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Moorea, French Polynesia. By employing a multi-omic approach to characterize the taxonomic, functional, and specialized metabolite composition within sediment communities, we find that biogeographic patterns were driven by local scale processes (e.g., biotic interactions) and largely independent of dispersal limitation. Specifically, we observed high variation in biosynthetic potential (based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) between samples, even within 1 m2 plots, that reflected uncharacterized chemical space associated with sediment metabolomes. Connecting biosynthetic potential to community metabolomes facilitated the in situ detection of natural products and revealed new insights into the complex metabolic dynamics associated with sediment microbial communities. Our study demonstrates the potential to integrate biosynthetic genes and metabolite production into assessments of microbial community dynamics.

# Metabolomics Impacting Community Composition
To determine how microbial community structure and specialized metabolism are linked at local spatial scales, we employed a multi-omic approach to characterize the taxonomic composition, functional and biosynthetic potential, and community metabolomes within reef-associated sediments
